/**
 * Classification precision metric (`TP / (TP + FP)`).
 *
 * Measures, among samples predicted to belong to a class, the fraction whose ground-truth
 * label actually matches that class. Supports both hard targets (`Int32` class indices) and
 * soft targets (`FP32` or `FP16` one-hot / probability distributions).
 *
 * For multi-class predictions (or when [threshold] is `null`), the class with maximum value
 * along [dim] is selected (`argmax`, breaking ties toward the lowest class index). When
 * [threshold] is provided and the class dimension has size `1` or `2`, predictions strictly
 * greater than [threshold] (at logit index `1` for 2-class tensors, or index `0` for single-logit
 * tensors) are classified as class `1`, and `0` otherwise.
 *
 * Zero-division convention: on a fresh or reset accumulator, or whenever a class (or pooled
 * total) has `TP + FP == 0`, the affected precision evaluates to `0.0` (never `NaN`).
 *
 * @param averaging Strategy used to aggregate per-class precision scores across classes
 *                  ([Averaging.MACRO] by default, [Averaging.MICRO], or [Averaging.BINARY]).
 * @param dim The dimension along which class logits or probabilities lie (default: `-1`, last dimension).
 * @param threshold Optional decision threshold for binary classification (`dim` size `1` or `2`).
